## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I was having difficulty getting my file size to shrink small enough to upload to GitHub without losing or deleting data. This problem was resolved by saving the file format as .xlsb which I learned after consulting with the instructor on tips. I also struggled with remembering to lock the referenced cells prior copying a formula to other cells. This resulted in an error in my numbers causing my charts to not match what was in the Module. Fortunately I was able to find my errors and fix them!

## Results

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - There is a higher chance of success if the date created is in May
  - The number failed remains fairly steady throughout the year 

* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Based on the Outcomes vs Goals Pivot Table, we can conclude that the chances of success are much higher if the Goal is less that 5000. We can also see a spike of success between 35000 and 45000.

* What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - Some limitations of the dataset would be how broad it is when referring to country. For example, in the US, some states may have better results over others which could result in better performance. 

* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - If you narrowed the search down to cities/states, you could make a bar graph to show results per location.
